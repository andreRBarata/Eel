This project's scope also includes the reimplementation of comumly used commands in the command-line's native language (Javascript) to make the output a better graphical visualization of the results, and to allow the usage of said commands in any platform. Planned features also include syntax highlighting and autocomplete.

Th have been some attempts to modernize the shell I came across while researching,

# Project Statement

For many years the concept of a command-line has not really changed, and has stayed not only intimidating for new users but also very limited in the way it can display information. This was fine when the totality of the interaction with the system was through the terminal but no longer makes sense given the current graphical capabilities of computers.

The goal of this project is to make possible new forms of interaction by creating a programmable, user-friendly command-line capable of working in multiple platforms, able to display images and documents in an easy to understand manner with a commands history and autocomplete.

Adding programmability in the form of an extended version of the JavaScript syntax and toolkit to include different methods for calling functions, pipes and redirections, and allowing usage of internal system commands and commands specific to this command-line interchangeably.

## Alternative Existing Solutions to Your Problem

### Bash

### Fish Shell

The Fish Shell is a shell language like Bash that adds an advanced autocomplete and highlighting

### ZShell

### Termkit

The idea for this project came from the now defunct project TermKit. It had as objective to create a graphical, user friendly interface for the traditional unix command-line as well as expanding the capabilities of some of the commands. This project came to a holt when it’s creator hit a blocker with WebKit, the engine he was using.

This project focused on getting an environment for the commands and as such did not implement a programing language or any scripting capabilities.
